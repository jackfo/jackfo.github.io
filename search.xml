    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The introduce of Netty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we often use an HTTP client library to retrieve information from a web server and to invoke a remote procedure call via web services. Netty is an NIO client server framework which enables quick and easy development of network applications such as protocol servers and clients. It greatly simplifies and streamlines network programming such as TCP and UDP socket server development. A example of NettyThe Main class&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this part, we introduce a simple process for a netty service. At first, we create multithreaded event loop that handles I/O operation and add them into corresponding server and add corresponding channel to transmit message. In this channel, we will create corresponding handle to receive the message, In this process, some handle can encode or decode the message. In the end, it will wait the message from client. 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384858687888990919293949596979899100101102103104105106107108109110111112113public class DiscardServer &#123; private int port; public DiscardServer(int port) &#123; this.port = port; &#125; public void run() throws Exception &#123; //bossGroup will accept an incoming connection EventLoopGroup bossGroup = new NioEventLoopGroup(); //workerGroup handles the traffic of the accepted connection once the bossGroup accepts the connection //and registers the accepted the connection to the worker EventLoopGroup workerGroup = new NioEventLoopGroup(); try &#123; //ServerBootstrap is a helper class that sets up a server. you can set up the server using channel ServerBootstrap serverBootstrap = new ServerBootstrap(); //we specify to use the NioServerSocketChannel class which is used to a new channel to accept incoming connection serverBootstrap.group(bossGroup, workerGroup) .channel(NioServerSocketChannel.class) //the handler specified here will always be evaluated by a newly channel //The ChannelInitializer's purpose is to help user configure a new channel and add some handler which can implement network application .childHandler(new ChannelInitializer&lt;SocketChannel&gt;() &#123; @Override public void initChannel(SocketChannel ch) throws Exception &#123; ch.pipeline().addLast(new DiscardServerHandler()); &#125; &#125;) //you can set some socket option by this way //option() is for the NioServerSocketChannel that accepts incoming connections. //childOption() is for the Channels accepted by the parent ServerChannel, which is NioServerSocketChannel in this case. .option(ChannelOption.SO_BACKLOG, 128) .childOption(ChannelOption.SO_KEEPALIVE, true); // Bind and start to accept incoming connections.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[java NIO buffer&emsp;&emsp; A buffer Object is a container of a fixed amount of data, it acts as a block or staging area, where data can be stored and later retrieved.Buffers work hand in glove with channels, Channels are portals through which i/o transfers take place, and buffers are the sources or targets of those data transfers. The family of buffer in java nio &emsp;&emsp; From the system diagram, we can find each of the basic data types has their own corresponding buffer class. as follows: ByteBuffershortBufferCharBufferIntBufferLongBufferFloatBufferDoubleBufferMappedByteBuffer Attributes&emsp;&emsp; Buffer is mainly has four attributes Capacity: The maximum number of data elements the buffer can hold. The capacity is set when the buffer is created and can never be changed. Limit: The first element of the buffer that should not be read or written. In other words, the count of live elements in the buffer. Position:The index of next element to be read or written. The position is updated automatically by get() and put() methods. Mark: A remembered position,Mark() and reset() are used together. when we use Mark(), we will record the position so that calling reset() sets position = mark The following relationship between these four attributes always holds: 0 &lt;= mark &lt;= position &lt;= limit &lt;= capacity Buffer interface The Usage of Buffer&emsp;&emsp; Now, i show how to use it and explain the source code through it’s the implementation class — ByteBuffer The constructor of it12345678910ByteBuffer(int mark, int pos, int lim, int cap, byte[] hb, int offset) &#123; super(mark, pos, lim, cap); this.hb = hb; this.offset = offset; &#125; // Creates a new buffer with the given mark, position, limit, and capacity ByteBuffer(int mark, int pos, int lim, int cap) &#123; this(mark, pos, lim, cap, null, 0); &#125; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; we can find the core of it invoke the superclass, at first we see the parent class constructor. it easy to find the superclass is Buffer 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657Buffer(int mark, int pos, int lim, int cap) &#123; if (cap &lt; 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("Negative capacity: " + cap); this.capacity = cap; limit(lim); position(pos); if (mark &gt;= 0) &#123; if (mark &gt; pos) throw new IllegalArgumentException("mark &gt; position: (" + mark + " &gt; " + pos + ")"); this.mark = mark; &#125; &#125; /** * Sets this buffer's limit.

Each method of them has corresponding judgment whether the property value whether meet the conditions. if not, it will throws corresponding exception. allocate a specify memory space12345//allocate a specify memory spaceByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);System.out.println(buf.position());System.out.println(buf.limit());System.out.println(buf.capacity()); 1234result:010241024 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the beginning of allocate a memory space to buffer, we can find the property value of position is 0, property values of limit and capacity is the value of the incoming. Buffer after five put( )s123456String str = "Hello"; //put data in the bufferbuf.put(str.getBytes());System.out.println(buf.position());System.out.println(buf.limit());System.out.println(buf.capacity()); 1234result:510241024 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the above code, I convert a string into a byte array and store it the buf instance. From the result, we can find the position has some change, limit and capacity don’t have any change. The model is shown. Switch to Read data mode&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing to follow the above code, we begin to read the data which we put in the above. At first we switch to read data mode by calling the flip() method. 123456public final Buffer flip() &#123; limit = position; position = 0; mark = -1; return this;&#125; 1234buf.flip();System.out.println(buf.position());System.out.println(buf.limit());System.out.println(buf.capacity()); result: 123051024 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flips this buffer. The limit is set to the current position and then the position is set to zero. If the mark is defined then it is discarded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After invoking the flip(), we begin to read the data in the buffer. Read data from buffer123456byte[] dst = new byte[buf.limit()];buf.get(dst);System.out.println(new String(dst, 0, dst.length));System.out.println(buf.position());System.out.println(buf.limit());System.out.println(buf.capacity()); result: 1234hello551024 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the code, we can find we build a byte array to read data from buffer. after reading it, The property value of position changed. The principle of it is after we invoke the get() method It can read the Reads the byte at this buffer’s current position, and then increments the position. The process of get() method is in its implementation class. Rewinds this buffer12345public final Buffer rewind() &#123; position = 0; mark = -1; return this; &#125; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The position is set to zero and the mark is discarded. Invoking this method before a sequence of channel-write or get operations, assuming that the limit has already been set appropriately. Clears this buffer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The position is set to zero, the limit is set to the capacity, and the mark is discarded.This method does not actually erase the data in the buffer, but it is named as if it did because it will most often be used in situations in which that might as well be the case. 123456public final Buffer clear() &#123; position = 0; limit = capacity; mark = -1; return this;&#125; hasRemaining()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tells whether there are any elements between the current position and the limit. if true, there is at least one element remaining in this buffer 123public final boolean hasRemaining() &#123; return position &lt; limit; &#125; The Compare BuffersDirect byte buffers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Direct byte buffers are usually the best choice for I/O operations. By design, they support the most efficient I/O mechanism available to the JVM.Direct buffers are optimal for I/O, but they may be more expensive to create than non direct byte buffers. The memory used by direct buffers is allocated by calling through to native, operating system-specific code, by passing the standard JVM heap. Setting up and tearing down direct buffers could be significantly more expensive than heap-resident buffers, depending on the host operating system and JVM implementation. The memory-storage areas of direct buffers are not subject to garbage collection because they are outside the standard JVM heap. —reference O’reilly java NIO The Method of creationstatic ByteBuffer allocateDirect(int capacity) 12345678910111213141516171819/** * Allocates a new direct byte buffer. * * &lt;p&gt; The new buffer's position will be zero, its limit will be its * capacity, its mark will be undefined, and each of its elements will be * initialized to zero.

It’s usually not possible for a non direct buffer to be the target of a native I/O operation. If you pass a non direct ByteBuffer object to a channel for write, the channel may implicitly do the following on each call: Create a temporary direct ByteBuffer object. Copy the content of the non direct buffer to the temporary buffer. Perform the low-level I/O operation using the temporary buffer. The temporary buffer object goes out of scope and is eventually garbage collected. —reference O‘reilly java NIO The Method of creation123456789101112131415161718192021/** * Allocates a new byte buffer. * * &lt;p&gt; The new buffer's position will be zero, its limit will be its * capacity, its mark will be undefined, and each of its elements will be * initialized to zero.
